To build a drupal site using this feature, run the make file located at:

https://raw.github.com/ezwart/skolr/master/skolr.site.build
  
Note: You'll need to set up drush (http://drupal.org/project/drush) 
and drush make (http://drupal.org/project/drush_make) to use this method.

Example:

$ wget https://raw.github.com/ezwart/skolr/master/skolr.site.build
$ drush make --prepare-install --contrib-destination=sites/default skolr.site.build drupal

This will create a folder named "drupal" in the current directory, and set up a settings.php
file in drupal/sites/default.  Contrib modules will be located in drupal/sites/default/modules/contrib, 
and the skolr feature will be in drupal/sites/default/modules/custom.
