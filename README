To build a drupal site using this feature, clone the repo, and run the dependencies.make file using Drush Make.  

Note: You'll need drush (http://drupal.org/project/drush) and drush make (http://drupal.org/project/drush_make) to use this method.

Steps:

1. clone the repo
2. drush make a drupal installation with all the necessary modules
3. create a db and user (optional: use if setting up the site for the first time)
4. no db yet: drush si to setup a db and settings.php file
   have db: edit settings php
5. enable the skolr module

Example 1 (no db yet):

$ git clone git://github.com/ezwart/skolr.git
$ cd skolr
$ drush make --prepare-install --contrib-destination=sites/default site.make drupal
$ mysql -u root -p

mysql> CREATE DATABASE skolr;
mysql> GRANT ALL ON skolr.* TO skolr@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'fakepwd';
mysql> exit

$ cd drupal
$ drush si --db-url="mysql://skolr:fakepwd@localhost/skolr" --site-name="Skolr"
$ drush en skolr -y

Example 2 (starting with an existing db):

$ git clone git://github.com/ezwart/skolr.git
$ drush make --prepare-install --contrib-destination=sites/default site.make drupal
$ cd drupal/sites/default
$ nano settings.php (edit $db_url)
$ drush en skolr -y


Note: after following these steps you'll have this repo in two places.  

1. the actual repo in the root folder (with .git folder), where you can make changes and commit/push them
2. the feature as part of the drupal site; you'll need to re-run drush si to get the lateset changes

Note, this is just one workflow.  You can of course set things up some other preferred way and change the relevant parts of the example accordingly.
