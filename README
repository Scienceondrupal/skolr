This feature begain its life as the DigitalOcean Poster Service (do_poster).  It's now being referred to by its other name, Skolr.

To build a drupal site using this feature, clone the repo, and run the dependencies.make file using Drush Make.  

Note: You'll need drush (http://drupal.org/project/drush) and drush make (http://drupal.org/project/drush_make) to use this method.

Steps:

1. clone the repo
2. drush make a drupal installation with all the necessary modules
3. create a db and user (optional: use if setting up the site for the first time)
4. drush si to setup a db and settings.php file
5. enable the skolr module (legacy name: do_poster)

Example:

$ git clone git://github.com/ezwart/skolr.git
$ drush make skolr/dependencies.make drupal
$ mysql -u root -p

(optional: use if setting up the site for the first time)
mysql> CREATE DATABASE skolr;
mysql> GRANT ALL ON skolr.* TO skolr@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'fakepwd';
mysql> exit

$ cd drupal
$ drush si --db-url="mysql://skolr:fakepwd@localhost/skolr" --site-name="Skolr"
$ drush en do_poster -y


After following these steps you'll have this repo in two places.  

1. the actual repo with .git folder at the root, where you can make changes and commit/push them
2. the feature as part of the drupal site, with no .git folder; you'll need to re-run drush si to get the lateset changes

Note, this is just one workflow.  You can of course set things up some other preferred way and change the relevant parts of the example accordingly.
